# MDFC Bank-Loan-Analysis_Power-BI

<b>Objective<b>:To establish a comprehensive overview of our lending operations through meticulous tracking of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). These KPIs serve as vital metrics in evaluating the performance and health of our loan portfolio. Our focus lies on the following key areas:

Total Loan Applications: Our first priority is to accurately calculate the total number of loan applications received within a specified timeframe. Furthermore, we emphasize monitoring Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications to ensure real-time awareness of application trends. Tracking changes Month-over-Month (MoM) provides valuable insights into the evolving demand for loans.

<b>Total Funded Amount<b>: Understanding the total funds disbursed as loans is fundamental to our operations. We meticulously track the Total Funded Amount, paying close attention to Month-to-Date (MTD) disbursements. Analyzing Month-over-Month (MoM) changes in this metric allows us to adapt strategies effectively and optimize resource allocation.

Total Amount Received: Efficient management of cash flow and loan repayment is critical for the bank's financial health. We diligently track the Total Amount Received from borrowers, assessing Month-to-Date (MTD) receipts. Monitoring Month-over-Month (MoM) changes enables us to identify patterns and proactively address any deviations.

Average Interest Rate: The average interest rate across all loans is a pivotal metric in evaluating the cost-effectiveness of our lending practices. We compute and analyze the Average Interest Rate, both MTD and MoM, to gain insights into the overall cost structure of our lending portfolio.

Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Evaluating the average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI) of our borrowers provides essential insights into their financial stability. We meticulously calculate the average DTI for all loans, tracking Month-to-Date (MTD) variations. Monitoring Month-over-Month (MoM) fluctuations allows us to assess changes in borrowers' financial health over time.
