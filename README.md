*  Monthly Trends by Issue Date- To identify seasonality and long-term trends in lending activities<br/>

* Regional Analysis by State - : To identify regions with significant lending activity and assess regional disparities<br/>

 applications.<br/>

* Loan Purpose Breakdown- Will provide a visual breakdown of loan metrics based on the stated purposes of loans, aiding in the understanding of the primary reasons borrowers seek financing<br/>

 *  Home Ownership Analysis -For a hierarchical view of how home ownership impacts loan applications and disbursements.
